When the state or the data of a component changes, React updates the
corresponding node in the virtual DOM to reflect the new state. Then, it compares
the current version of virtual DOM with the previous version to identify the nodes
that should be updated. Itâ€™ll then update those nodes in the actual DOM.

In browser-based apps, updating the DOM is done by a companion library called
ReactDOM. In mobile apps, React Native uses native components to render the
user interface.

Since React is just a library and not a framework like Angular or Vue, we often
need other tools for concerns such as routing, state management,
internationalization, form validation
